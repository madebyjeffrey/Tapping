MikeOscarNovemberEchoYankee: A Project
======================================

This project is designed to allow me to learn some of the issues related to iOS development with the purpose of improving my iOS development experience. 

It was originally intended as a commercial product, but my experience - or lack thereof - is proving to be a hinderance and I will not put out garbage. So this project, is being put out where to help myself with suggestions and hopefully help anyone else doing anything remotely similar.

You will find CAShapeLayers of pie slices in BoardView, its hit testing in Board-Events, and some audio in Tone. The audio is going through the most change right now because I am just learning audio synthesis. 

I have tried to design this project with a good separation of responsibilities following my understanding of a Model - View - Controller design.

In consideration of what the purpose of this code is, I do not want this code to be copied at posted as an app on the store. Therefore, I license this code to be used as a learning tool and pieces can be used for any purpose - with the understanding that you are not permitted to take the app with little or no modification and put it up in an appstore.
